Qbccd,1595087905,"So I was looking into 5G -- the mid-band type that operates in the 2.5-3.7 GHz range can deliver speeds around 100-900 Mbps. This appears to be very similar to Wi-Fi as it sits between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands and delivers speeds that are also somewhere in between those Wi-Fi bands for 802.11ax.

But the difference is that the 5G signal can cover a several mile radius and penetrate many obstacles, whereas Wi-Fi can barely travel 150 ft and go through 2 walls. What gives? My first instinct was that the cell tower antennas are much more powerful than a Wi-Fi access point. But that doesn't quite check out because a phone can transmit 100+ mbps to the tower theoretically with a sub 1W antenna. And if Wi-Fi was capable of that kind of range with powerful antennas, we'd see public/municipal WiFi covering 30 sq miles. 

So how can mid-band 5G achieve much greater range?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does 5G reach so much farther than Wi-Fi if it uses similar frequency bands?

With that much profit being made off of employee labor, why *wouldn't* companies pay for lunch breaks? Because 30 minute lunch breaks (at $13/hr) equals $32.50 at the end of a five day week. So in theory an entire week of 30 min lunch breaks could be paid for with the profit made off of \~1hr of an employee's time.

I'm a student doctor who wants to make science and medicine accessible for everyone on YouTube, so I've made a video where I walk you guys on what placebos actually are and why not all placebos are equal and what that tells us about the nature of placebos; that they're largely rooted in expectation.

As in you feel better after taking a sugar pill, largely because you expect to feel better.

Why are we able to ultimately plant individual pots and small plants on the window sill (and they can grow), but the idea of attempting a garden indoors to set up an area that isn't disturbed by wildlife seems impossible? 

I thought it could've been that the sunlight isn't enough for a small garden vs an individual plant pot, but i'm not sure that that makes much sense. 

If we can figure out how to essentially have indoor gardens.. we wouldn't need to use pesticides to keep animals off our fruits and veggies and we could grow crops year round that before were impossible to grow year round.

Incidentally, when we first met he was scared of me because I‘m Asian and he said he had a nightmare about the grudge and distrusted (East) Asians ever since (from what I remember).

I asked him when this stuff starting happening and he said smoking marijuana brought about his awakening of sorts. I thought it weird because I don’t see how that would occur considering it just makes you feel calm and hungry, right? 

I don’t know if he just said that and took some other drug, but that’s what I remember and that leads me to the question that could weed bring out symptoms of someone whose disorder was “under the wraps”?

I was listening to this song called Kiri by Monoral on Spotify when I realized that my closed-back Philips PH805, which I recently bought, sounds different; and different as in awful. Between 0:12 and 0:15, there's what I assume to be an overdrive effect on the guitar that is lost to hearer when the cans are worn full-fit. Maybe you can experience it, too, if you take the headphones off and keep them a few inches away from your ears.

Why is this the case? I assume it's to do with my cans being closed-back. I can't recall experiencing an effect or sound being this drastically lost.

Nobody in my family has ever lived in an apartment before so from what I understand leases and subleases are just agreements that you’ll live and pay rent for a certain amount of months but subleases are given out by people who are tenants and have a lease? How do people pay their landlords? Do they write up checks or is it set up where it’s automatically deducted from your bank account? Is the length of leases preset (6 or 12 months) or will some places let me customize it for a certain amount of months?

I grew up in a situation where I was basically locked in my house and ""home schooled"" so I don't really have a great grasp on the world around me and how it spins. Please bear with me. 

Anyways, I've had a credit card with a $500 credit limit for about six months. I pay it off every month and I get a certain % back on purchases. I got it just to make little purchases to help build my credit score. Since having it my credit score has had a very slow and steady trend upward.

Recently, I finally bit the bullet and went to the dentist (something I had no idea I was supposed to do regularly) and I had to get $4,000 of work done. They reassured me that I could open a line of credit with a company called Care Credit and for the first 12 months I would have no interest.

Technically, I had the money. I had $5,000 to my name at the time of the work, but I didn't want to drain my savings and bank account for fear of an emergency happening and me not having the money I needed to solve said hypothetical issue. 

So anyways, I log into my new credit account and it says ""no payment due"" which confuses me because I'm 4k in debt.. Should I make $333 payments/monthly anyways to help my credit score? Should I pay off all of my debt now with the money I have saved up? What's the best way to go about paying this debt off, that will help my credit score out the most in the long run?

Can someone explain and expand on it in a little more depth?

How was it done before, what the feature changed, why isn't there performance benefits from it right now? (i realize performance loss is a bug more or less)

Here's what I understand and found from my testing

1. I read the Microsoft dev blog post and understood that it helps the gpu manage its own vram, and it reduces latency by dumping Draw calls or something on the gpu itself (i don't know what to call it i realize the CPU does the draw calls, just not sure what it changes about how it's done)

2. From my testing on a laptop with 1060 maxQ 6gb is that there is no performance difference but vram usage is around 10% higher (from other testing as well)

weeksie98,1594593848,"Hi everyone,

I've been watching the 'Boundary Break' series on YouTube focusing on taking the camera outside maps on video games (in this case, Zelda: OOT) to see what we otherwise wouldn't be able to, and I've noticed a common theme. Developers seem to treat the digital worlds and assets they create as though they were dealing with physical items in physical space. Let me give an example.

Say in Zelda, you are entering a room in which there's a boss fight, but the boss hasn't appeared yet. It's a very long (as in physically long) boss. But rather than it just spawning in when it needs to, the boss is already there, stored under the map. You can't see it, but it's in the room. Not only that, but in OOT, the boss is folded up as though there wasn't enough space for it down where it's stored!

Why is this? Why is the boss folded when there must be unlimited space to store assets if the developers want it, and why do they need to store them out of sight at all? This is a game - can't they just spawn them when necessary? Could it be something to do with having one chance on entry into the room to load all assets without interrupting play?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do game developers store assets outside the map rather than just spawn them when needed?

AkulaSub,1594580663,"I searched for posts about this on here already but they all seem to be about what virtue signaling is, not why it's seen so immediately negative.

I want to preface this post by saying that I understand that there can be negative instances of virtue signaling where people are incredibly disingenuous with their words while attempting to look virtuous without actually doing anything or when large corporations virtue signal purely for profit and to show how ""woke"" they are. I realize this is a reality which people exploit for their own personal gain. I'm more focusing on why it seems to be viewed as an inherently negative thing regardless of context. 

So I just saw a post on r/pics or something, the subject being a sign stuck to a shop window basically saying they will refuse service to anyone who is not wearing a mask, is racist, or homophobic. In the photo, there is no mention of the shops' name or location or anything so it couldn't really be a marketing strategy by posting it online, but I realize it COULD be to the people walking by on the street. The key word here is ""could"", though. The post has been completely bombarded by comments calling it out for virtue signaling and being disingenuous, and I could just be really ignorant, but I do not understand how someone could determine with complete certainty that this establishment is putting this sign in the window purely to virtue signal to people in the name of profits and for no other reason. I feel like it is just as likely that they put the sign in the window because they want to publicly show they do no support these ideals, their shop does not support or represent these ideals, and they will not be tolerated while inside their shop. I see literally zero problem with this. I didn't realize empathy is no longer a valid reason for doing something. 

I know several small business owners who have signs up in their shops with similar messages to show solidarity during this turbulent time, and in the case of rejecting people without masks, to protect themselves and their employees. I know for a fact they are not doing it with the hidden intention of profiting off of their ""wokeness"" or whatever, it's just them caring about something and wanting to spread awareness and show empathy. Am I misguided for thinking this shouldn't be such a controversial subject?

michaellobry,1594507743,"**What is Nocebo:**

Opposite of Placebo. The nocebo effect is a decrease in subjective benefit, a worsening of symptoms or onset of adverse effects due to an expectation or perception of harm associated with a medicine or other treatment

The nocebo effect is influenced by factors such as healthcare beliefs, previous experiences, health professional interactions, written and verbal information about medicines, mainstream and social media and social modelling (modified behaviour due to observation of others response to treatment)

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution:**

* Be Empathetic
* Provide Positive Instruction
* Create Positive Expectations
* Build Positive Client Perception
* Set Up Success Through Priming

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:**

Many people with nocebo still struggle with their bad habit/thought/etc.

If they try the correct habit/thought, then they will CRY (because of uncaring, or they become stern, dull, unsentimental, unsympathetic, hateful, as they have learned to love the bad and hate the good). Even the most positive-minded or convincing friends/specialists are unable to influence them for the better, because he won't change his habit and in the end HE is the only person who can change, no one else can do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Negative cycle** (this is how the Nocebo person thinks):

\--&gt; 'I learned to accept the bad habit', 'and I'm okay with that, I accept that, I learned to hate the good habit when young'

\--&gt; 'So I don't have motivation to change the bad habit into a good habit'

\--&gt; 'So nothing can convince me'

\--&gt; 'So I will feel sad with the bad habit, as well as the good habit (because doing the good habit makes me cry)'

I've never heard a frog croak in my highly urbanized neighborhood all my life. Or if I have (I understand frogs can sound like bugs to the untrained ear), then they were in isolated, easily missed incidents, because around here I don't even hear night bugs very often, and I say that as someone who enjoys going out at night to soak in what little nature there is. But just this evening, all of a sudden, I'm hearing a huge, gargantuan, monstrous melody of what might as well be a hundred frogs erupting from one single bushy corner of my backyard.

I don't mind this at all; I welcome my new amphibious neighbors. But I'm just so confused by this. I've never heard so many frogs in all my life in this dry, concrete place.

Frogs used to be common, several decades ago, when there were more ditches, fields, and ponds, but those have disappeared long ago, most of them paved over. Where did these frogs come from? Is this a natural occurrence? How did they materialize all at once when on the previous night there wasn't even a single croak outside? Keep in mind, I live in the middle of this neighborhood, a long walk from the nearest ditch, and both of my next-door neighbors' backyards are almost devoid of grass and bushes, just concrete floors with a few potted plants and a couple trees.

My dad has been working on a garden lately, and now the middle of the yard has so much foliage, but these frogs aren't even near his garden, they're in a corner far from it, which hardly gets watered, if at all.

jjdacuber,1594430870,"So yesterday i did a presentation on the atmosphere in science class. The day before, I was researching for the presentation and i came across a sentence in the textbook that says meteors burn in the atmosphere due to friction with the air. I could've sworn I read somewhere that meteors burning due to friction with the air is a common myth.

Sure enough I found a sentence in Randall Munroe's *What-If*(one of my favorite books) that said meteors burn because the air getting compressed in front of them heats them up, not because of friction, which is what is commonly believed. Upon doing some googling I also found more or less the same idea on wikipedia and [space.com](https://space.com).

We were gonna get tested on this stuff, so at the end of my presentation i asked the teacher about it, whether meteors burn due to friction or compression- personally i was sure it was compression, and i showed everyone the sources from what-if, [space.com](https://space.com) and wikipedia. (i should add i wasn't being a teacher- contradicting jerk, i asked politely and respectfully)

The sources i showed didn't look reliable enough to the teacher(IMO wikipedia is a reliable source but a lot of people disagree), she was very skeptical about the compression explanation, saying that if the air was compressed that much it would turn to liquid (or something along the lines of that) I also said air compression is why the pumps you use for party balloons get hot when you pump a lot, but she said that too was due to friction with the air. Could anyone explain once and for all what is the truth? Citing scientific/reliable sources is also greatly appreciated! thanks!",explainlikeimfive,eli5: Do meteors burn on entering the atmosphere because of friction or because of air compression?

retroretina,1594428324,"I overheard a conversation  from my SO who works for a homebuilder about the correct way to calculate price per square foot averages for the company.  The conversation was trying to figure out which way to calculate this. Option one was to calculate the average for each house, then average those averages.  This seems to make sense to me.  Option two would be to add up all the prices, then divide by the sum of total square footage.  This would also give an average; but different from the first.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is which way would give a more accurate representation of the average price per square foot?

Option One Visualized

Before this she'd never had memory issues so I was freaking out internally. I had to repeatedly tell her he'd died and that the funeral was tomorrow. She wanted to know where his body was, could she see him, was everything sorted for funeral arrangements and costs.

I'd like to know what the science behind that is, I do understand that water evaporates and the salt that absorbs the water remains in the cup, but what factors contribute to one glass crystalizing faster than another. My room is a decent sized room and the glass sits on a shelf next to my collection of cubes and the only other things in my room are my desk with my PC and my bed and a giant window.

godzillabacter,1594244535,"I have a Nikon D500 and shoot entirely in losslessly-compressed 14-bit camera RAW files (.NEF).

Why are these other lossless formats not able to compress as efficiently as RAW files?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Lossless image file formats and their sizes
